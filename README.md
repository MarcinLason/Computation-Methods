# Mownit
Repository of files created by preparing to labolatories of subject Mownit (Numerical Analysis):

Lab1:
  Exercise1: Sinus and cosinus series expansion with comparison with library solutions.
  Exercise2: Partial Sums method to compare double and float precision.
  Exercise3: Creating bifurcation diagram
  
Lab2:
  Exercise1: Gauss-Jordan elimination with complete pivoting compared to library solution.
  Exercise2: LU factorization with partial pivoring.
  Exercise3: Electrical circuit based on Kirhoff's rules. Graph represents an electrical circuit, with SEM and resistances.                   Implemented mainly in Java, only visualisation was done in Python. Resolved graph represents cuircuit with color map              to show particular current values.
